# Personal AppDaemon Apps

These are my own personal [AppDaemon](http://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) apps for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/). I hope they are useful for you.

Use them at your own peril.

You can install them all by simply cloning this repo from within your AppDaemon `app_dir` directory. You may want to rename it. e.g.:

``` bash
cd /config/appdaemon/apps/
git clone git@github.com:PhilRW/appdaemon-apps.git philrw-apps
```
